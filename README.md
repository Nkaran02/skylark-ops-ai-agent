# Skylark Ops AI Agent Dashboard

## Overview

Skylark Ops AI Agent is a web-based operational assistant dashboard designed to help with drone fleet and pilot operations using predefined AI-driven queries. The application focuses on simplifying operational decision-making by allowing users to trigger common operational workflows directly from the dashboard.

This project is currently in the **development phase**, and the system is optimized to work with a fixed set of predefined operational queries to ensure reliable and consistent responses.

## Current Status

🚧 **Development In Progress**

- The application is under active development.
- Backend and AI integrations are being iteratively improved.
- Some dynamic/free-text queries may not return results.
- The dashboard is currently designed to work best with predefined operational queries.

---

## How to Use the Dashboard

To ensure the application returns data correctly, please use the following **predefined operational queries** available in the dashboard:

- **Show available pilots**  
- **Available drones**  
- **Check conflicts**  
- **Urgent reassignment**  
- **Update pilot Arjun busy**  
- **Assign pilot**  

These predefined queries are connected to the current data and logic in the system. Using custom or free-form queries may not return results at this stage.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main dashboard UI
- `script.js` — Frontend logic and query handling
- `styles.css` — UI styling and layout
- `data/` — Operational mock or test data (if applicable)

---

## Known Limitations

- Free-text queries may not return results
- Hosted version may differ slightly from local environment
- API and data sources are still being stabilized
- Limited dataset for demo and testing purposes

---

## Future Improvements

- Full dynamic natural language query support
- Real-time backend integration
- Expanded operational datasets
- Enhanced UI/UX for enterprise-grade usage
- Role-based access and audit logs
