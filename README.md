Skylark Ops AI Agent

Skylark Ops AI Agent is an intelligent operations management system designed to automate and optimize drone mission assignments using AI-based decision logic and real-time data synchronization with Google Sheets.

This project simulates a real-world AI-powered operations control center where drones, pilots, and missions are continuously monitored, matched, and reassigned to avoid conflicts and maximize operational efficiency.
